# HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003) Exam Requirements: A Comprehensive Guide

Welcome back! This section provides a detailed overview of the requirements for the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003) exam. This certification validates your foundational knowledge and skills in using Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC). It's designed for cloud engineers, operations specialists, and developers looking to prove their proficiency in managing infrastructure with Terraform.

The exam is **multiple-choice**, **1 hour in duration**, and typically costs **$70.50 USD**. You need to achieve a score of **66% or higher** to pass. While production experience is beneficial, performing the exam objectives in a demo environment can be sufficient for preparation.
